# Remote-Control-Joystick-Android-App
Our application is a remote control for a flight simulator located on the computer.
It consists of two activities:
1. MainActivity is responsible for connecting the flight simulator.
In order to connect, enter the ip address of your computer and the port that the simulator listens to.
2. JoystickActivity is responsible for controlling the plane's flight, 
using a joystick and two seek bars that set the aileron, elevator, rudder and throttle values.
